Design Process
--------------
This website was built to act as my personal portfolio that can be used in th future. I want to highlight areas about myself and the projects that I have been through.
As i am not experienced in the IT industry, i need to further highlight the skills that i already possess in order to gain the attention of others.
As a user that visits this website, I want to be attracted them to this website to continue to stay on the website and continue reading. 
As a user, i would also want a website to be clear and concise while not being too wordy, this allows me to better navigate where I am on the website as it is neater and is more pleasing to the eye. 
As a user, i would also want the website to be a fully functioning website with little or no bugs, links to be clear on where it will link to.

As part of the Design Process, i have created a wireframe which can be assessed through the following link:
