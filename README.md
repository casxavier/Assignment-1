Design Process
--------------
This website was built to act as my personal portfolio that can be used in th future. I want to highlight areas about myself and the projects that I have been through.
As i am not experienced in the IT industry, i need to further highlight the skills that i already possess in order to gain the attention of others.
As a user that visits this website, I want to be attracted them to this website to continue to stay on the website and continue reading. 
As a user, i would also want a website to be clear and concise while not being too wordy, this allows me to better navigate where I am on the website as it is neater and is more pleasing to the eye. 
As a user, i would also want the website to be a fully functioning website with little or no bugs, links to be clear on where it will link to.

As part of the Design Process, i have created a wireframe which can be assessed through the following link:

Features
--------
Navigation Bar- allows user to click onto different pages of the website with a colour difference for the box that represents the page, allowing the user to be aware of which page they are currently at.

Photo Gallery- displays the schools I studied at and allows users to click on the next/previous picture. When the screen size is less than 550px, users would have to click on the buttons below the picture to go to the next/previous picture. Also has number to represent which picture the user is currently on

Social accounts link- allows the user to easily visit my LinkedIn Profile to find out even more about me or connect with me further.

Form- allows the user to submit a form with questions that they want to ask me through email if it is easier for them.
when users submit the form with all fields successfully filled in, there would be an alert to inform the user the form has been successfully filled in.

Future feautres to implement:
. if applicable, use a video to describe my projects and experiences
. include even more social links
. the form to have an action to my personal email, allowing me to view the question people have asked me and reply to them
